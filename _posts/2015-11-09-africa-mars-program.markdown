There is intense interest in the planet mars at the moment, everybody except Africa, seems to be headed that way:

# Background
1. *China* is investing significant amounts in it's mars lander program [CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/04/asia/china-mars-probe-2020/)
2. *India* has launched a mars orbiter [Space.com](http://www.space.com/23203-india-mars-orbiter-mission-photos.html)
3. *The UAE*:  Mars Hope [spaceref.com](http://spaceref.com/mars/uae-unveils-mission-plan-for-the-first-arab-space-probe-to-mars.html)
4. The *EU* with it's [Mars Express Mission](http://spaceref.com/mars/uae-unveils-mission-plan-for-the-first-arab-space-probe-to-mars.html)
And of course all the usual suspects: The *USA*, and *Russia*.

The ["Mars to Stay"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_to_Stay) agenda has been gaining ground, with the intention of inhabiting Mars and making mankind a 2 planet species.  There is strong evidence that there may have been intermittent flows of [water on mars.](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-confirms-evidence-that-liquid-water-flows-on-today-s-mars), this makes for a dramatically improved chance of human habitability.

#The future sociology of Mars
I invite you to contemplate with me the consequences of the colonisation of Mars.

1. What all be the composition/structure of the Mars colony of the future, given the current momentum of progress on Earth? 
1. Who will these people be? 
1. Will African's be represented? 
1. How many and under what conditions will the Martian population of African origin live? (If there are any?) 
1. If there are resources of significant economic value, which nations will benefit the most from those resources? 
1. Will access to Mars significantly change the economic and political balance on Earth?

These are interesting questions, about which one can only hypothesise , because what we, as Africans do now, will determine the answers.

It would seem to me that it is imperative that Africa makes a play for Mars.

The traditional narrative of the African situation seems to be that we are bedevilled by myriad plagues: wars, famines, epidemics of novel and ridiculously dangerous diseases, a low quality of life and all manner of *bad things*.  In that ludicrous depiction of the African experience, going to Mars might be construed as over reaching - and I know this argument will come, But if like me, you are truly African then you know these things to be a grotesque misrepresentation of the facts. (You are reading this on the internet, aren't you?)

I think in a very off-hand way, I have made a case for Africa going to Mars. 

#Going Forward
There needs to be an African Colony on Mars by 2030. (Earlier, of course, would be better)
