Lets put this in context: I am just back from the the polo club where I have been pretty much the whole afternoon. The chaps and I have been quaffing copious quantities of the frothy  stuff and !bing! a brain wave.  Remeber it is now 3am in the morning when I am writing this and there is every chance that I will sorely regret this literary effort.<br /><br />The Congo is in a parlous state - armed insurgents, looting rapine and mayhem, gore galore. How can we stop this carnage. My idea a fire suppression field! If we had some way to prevent guns working the largely unarmed and therefore victim population is on par with thier oppressors and have a fighting chance of getting even and putting a halt to the chaos. A nolle prosequi, a return to the status quo ante etc etc<br /><br />A microwave heats water by irradiating it with 2.4GHz waves. Is there a frequency at which we can heat gun powder so that it heats up and explodes? Does a bullet act like a Faraday cage and prevent us from finding a resonant frequency for gun powder? Can we irradiate ammunition so that it explodes? Can this be done in a short enough period that it can be used to dissuade people from carrying guns? Can we use this at airports? Yeah, I know, it is a bunch of questions not answers - so make of it what you will.<br /><br />Hmmmm .. bears thinking about and further research. I am almost certain there is a fundamental flaw in this idea, otherwise it would have been a product by now. Point it out if you can!!!!!
