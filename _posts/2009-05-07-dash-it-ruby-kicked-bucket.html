Yet another post equine sports posting. I have been tippling at the Abuja polo club again. Par for the course, about average behaviour, standard practice, a thing entirely to be expected of a hot Wednesday afternoon. My gizzard has turned pink or so the good doctor assures me ( A bean on whom reliance may be placed in defining a cocktail, but whose anatomical knowledge is on par with that of a somewhat flat sedimentary rock).<br /><br />I just learn't that my comrade of many adventures - the hound Ruby got hit by a car this afternoon in Jos - she is in extremis -  the vet is doing his very best to ease her passage. I am naturally morose as a consequence, positively melancholic. I have to go to Jos in the morning.
