This is my first foray into the wonderful world of blogging and I have been thinking about how to go about it. I have, up to now, written little notes to myself which I called ruminations and always intended to investigate further. Things being as they are, I haven't made much progress in the research programme that I set for myself a decade ago and many of those ruminations lie is sad little heaps in little known directories on myriad laptops, all over the world. So I have determined to experiment with blogging, I have spent a total of 8 minutes looking up and thinking through the political, social, economic and scientific impact of blogging and it violates every tenet of privacy, conservatism and individuality that I can think of: so I am going to do it!<br /><br />When breaking the rules, I was told when very young, do it with outward confidence. I am setting myself a few very simple rules, to wit:<br /><ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Words taste great:</span> As I think, so I write. I make bold assertions with the sure and certain knowledge that I may be wrong and I have no qualms about eating my words, doing a volte-face, and chomping vigorously on my previous verbiage (ruminating).<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eclectic:</span> All of it goes here (when I remember to update this blog!) and not in little notes all over the place</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">No going back</span>: Once written, forever posted! By keeping track of where I was wrong I am better able to learn how to be wrong better. So I will not be removing posts once posted under any circumstances. (makes me more of a public nuisance and gives the egg on the face a substantially better spread)</li></ol>It is utterly unlikely that this blog is going to get much of a readership, outside of all the usual suspects, so I think it is a low risk, low visibility expose of ignorance, conclusion jumping, bias, illogicality and mental arrogance.
