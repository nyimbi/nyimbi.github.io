I have lately been thinking about how to give back something to society (or better still get YOU to give something to society) and came up with this idea.<br /><br />I propose to setup a <span style="font-weight: bold;">virtual web based NGO</span> where you can donate time (say 3-5 hours a month). We auction your time and the money goes to a charity of your choice. The charity can be anywhere in the world. I anticipate that corporations that want your skills on a short term basis will bid and pay for it. Corporations get their work done and can feel good about getting the job done and also contributing to the greater good.<br /><br />When you register to donate your time, you list your skills and the total number of hours that you can donate per month. Corporations can search for the skills they are looking for on a job-work basis and bid for your time. You can either list a charity or charities can register and seek donations.<br /><br />As an added bonus, you the person donating time can track what the bids are on your time, and the total number of hours you have worked in a month. In order refine the bidding process, people who have previously paid for your time can comment on the quality of the deliverables to guide future bidders. The nature of work that you do, and the deliverables remain confidential between you and the corporation.<br /><br />At this time, I think this model will work best with paper work, documentation, design, language translations, software development and that sort of thing. It might be a little hard to cover manual work that requires physical presence, but it might be possible.<br /><br /><br />Will you participate?
