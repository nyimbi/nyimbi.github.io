<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I recently had a discussion on ethics, governance and doing business in the Africa. Over the course of a long a varied career as a technical entrepreneur I have witnessed a great deal that was fishy, odd, wrong or just plain yuck-making. I haven't however had reason or inclination to develop a coherent theory/hypothesis of how corruption works and how to combat it. I set out some thoughts on observations and conversations I have had. I need to make it clear that I have a profound abhorrence for corruption in any of its forms, it is a distasteful and ugly thing that needs to vanish from the face of the earth.<br /><br />Let us take it for granted that corruption is wrong and needs to be eliminated. This is not as obvious a statement as it may seem on the surface - I have heard a plethora or arguments in support of the system of kick-backs, over-invoicing, and corruption in general. I limn some of the arguments for bribery and corruption:<br /><ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Argument of Necessity</span>: The organization is not paying a living wage. (i.e. a wage on which one can reasonably expect to cover the cost of the basic necessities of life) The person needs to live. The organization owes them a living since they are working for it and so they are obliged to take from the organization to live.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Argument of Enhanced Natural Selection</span>: Bureaucracies are inherently inefficient and slow, more so unstructured, long-standing bureaucracies. Effective well capitalized, well-funded businesses can by means of paying bribes locally and temporarily optimize the processes of the bureaucracy and achieve results much faster. Inefficient, ineffective organizations which are not well-funded and are less capable of paying bribes (and thus weaker and less likely to survive) will get results slower and thus die out quicker. Letting weak organizations die is good for the entrepreneurial gene pool and this is a good for society.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Argument of Appropriate Taxation</span>: This circular argument goes like this: inefficient bureaucracies are ineffective at collecting taxes. Corporations have a duty to pay taxes to support the provision of government services. Since the corporations make every effort to avoid paying taxes, they should pay for services at the point and time of delivery hence bribery is merely taxation under another name.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Argument of Culture</span>: The culture requires the giving of gifts and the saying of thank you when somebody does something for you. What you call a bribe is merely a mandatory gift.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Argument of Innocuity</span>: Government services are underpriced and so by paying a bribe you are merely paying market rates for the service you are receiving. An efficient market is a good thing, and paying the correct price is a good thing thus you must pay a corrected price for the service or good that you want from government.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">etc, etc.</span> There are myriad justifications for bribery, graft, patronage and embezzlement.</li></ol>In trying to understand the structural requirements for corruption in government it is useful to picture the government as a system within a larger social system. (Yeah, yeah - I know the political theorists will be up in arms about this characterization.) Think of it as a circle within another circle. [Don't have the inclination to fire up inkscape and draw this!] Think of the citizenry as little polka dots throughout the two circles. When a citizen wants services from the government draw a circle from a dot outside the inner circle to the circumference of the inner circle. The civil servant is a dot on the periphery of the inner circle, an interface if you will with government. For purposed of discussion let us call the citizen or corporation wishing to get a service or good from government the accessor, let us call the civil-servant the interface and the seat of value the institution (it could be a government, organization, institution, whatever). In order for corruption to thrive, we can deduce the following requirements from this model:<br /><ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Value</span>: The inner circle (institution) must have some value that the citizens wish to access. Without this value, there will be no need for citizens/corporations to seek services or goods from the government. The greater the value, the larger the number of people who will want access.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Interface</span>: The narrower the access interface the greater the possible stringency of the requirements. Thus the fewer the channels of access to the inner circle good the higher the chances of corruption. The higher the specialization of the interface the greater the potential for corruption. The larger the number of equivalent interfaces the smaller the possibility of corruption. (A social network/communications characterization would fit in here very neatly - will go think about that)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Numerosity</span>: The larger the number of people that the government serves the more frequent the access and the more intense the pressure on the interface. The larger the pressure, the more likely it is that discriminants such as bribery will emerge as filters and buffers on the pressure.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Interaction Duration</span>: The longer the interaction duration, the greater the control of interface elements over access activities. Thus we can generalize that the longer the provision of a government service takes the higher the probability of corruption occuring.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Process Complexity</span>: The greater the complexity of the process, the greater the control the interface has over the accessor. The more steps, hand-offs, forms, requirements, and technical complexity of input or outcome, the greater the possibility of corruption.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Time Criticality</span>: The more time critical, the greater the control of the interface and the greater the value of the service.</li></ol>It has just occurred to me that I can model this whole system, the interactions and characteristics using an alternate scheme. More on this - If I ever get to it. In any event:<br /><br />To reduce corruption:<br /><ul><li>Reduce the power and singularity of interfaces</li></ul>I suppose in some convoluted way that means less government.</div>
