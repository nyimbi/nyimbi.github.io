I recently saw a documentary on the Laser Interferometry Gravitational Wave Observatory<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO">(LIGO)</a>, and it was particularly entertaining. It is a subject I haven't thought of for a really long time and it was great seeing that new thinking.<br /><br />Very simply, the LIGO is essentially two Orthogonal laser beams intersecting at a point and canceling out (interfering). If one of the arms changes in length, because of a gravitational wave, then there will be reduced interference at the point where they intersect - by detecting the change in light intensity/shift etc you can determine the amount by which the length of the arm changed (unless of course the change in length is exactly one wavelength of the light - I suppose). This is an extremely simplistic description, but may cover the main points.<br /><br />Now consider this:<br /><ol><li>The speed of light (c) is constant. What that means to me, and this is the crux of the matter, is that in all circumstances a proximal observer will find that the distance traversed by a beam of in a finite fixed time is the same. Simplistically the observer uses a meter rule and measures out the distance traversed in a fixed finite time.</li><li>A gravitational wave stretches space-time. (We make a host of assumptions right here.)<br /></li><li>Objects properly included in a space stretch or contract with the space. So the observer's meter rule stretches and contracts in the space.</li></ol>So we now find that:<br /><ol><li>If c is constant, then if the space stretches of contracts then the wavelength must contract or expand based on the change in the relative contraction of space-time. (We assume that the frequency is fixed - for no real reason actually, we could work with frequency instead of wavelength but I can think of no reason at present to vary frequency)</li><li>There is no way for a person in a space to determine that the space he occupies has stretched or contracted, because all means of determining that have altered in just such a manner as to prevent that discovery.</li></ol>Now on to LIGO:<br /><ol><li>The premise of LIGO is that the two arms will stretch differently in the presence of a gravitational wave.</li><li>The Gedanken experiment we conducted previously, would indicate that no characteristic of light (=laser) will change in any direction because of such a contraction of space time.</li><li>At the point of intersection we have a homgeneous space time (assuming a mathematical point - hence homogeneous by definition).</li><li>Ergo: There will be no interference. It would appear to me that there can be no detectable interference, so we can't expect anything from this rig.</li></ol>Now:<br />I must be missing something essential because a whole bunch of really smart people have bought into this whole business and I can't for the life of me think what it is.
