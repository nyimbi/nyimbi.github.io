This is a repository for my public domain thoughts and notions. Some of it may be of interest, most of it is of merely historical value to me. I am trying out an experiment of working out in the open. some of the stuff that you will see here are:

1. Ruminations: Thought pieces on various subjects
1. How-To's on various things I have tried to do and need to remember
1. Bookmarks of interest (Along the lines of (Awesome lists)[https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome]
1. Links to projects and code that I have worked on
1. Lessons learn't and stuff like that
1. My joke repository (Hahaha)
1. And whatever else I want to put here :-)
