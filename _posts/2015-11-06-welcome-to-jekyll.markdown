There is intense interest in the planet mars at the moment, everybody except Africa, seems to be headed that way:

1. China is investing significant amounts in it's mars lander program [CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/04/asia/china-mars-probe-2020/)
2. India has launched a mars orbiter [Space.com](http://www.space.com/23203-india-mars-orbiter-mission-photos.html)
3. The UAE:  Mars Hope [spaceref.com](http://spaceref.com/mars/uae-unveils-mission-plan-for-the-first-arab-space-probe-to-mars.html)
4. The EU with it's Mars Express Mission [wikipedia.org](http://spaceref.com/mars/uae-unveils-mission-plan-for-the-first-arab-space-probe-to-mars.html)
And of course all the usual suspects: The USA, and Russia.

The ["Mars to Stay"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_to_Stay) agenda has been gaining ground, with the intention of inhabiting Mars and making mankind a 2 planet species. This seems to me, given that we now know there may be intermittent flows of water on mars [nasa.gov](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-confirms-evidence-that-liquid-water-flows-on-today-s-mars)
